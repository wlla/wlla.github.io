  <p>Hello! I am a librarian. I work in Digital Accessibility (and NYC.) I wanted a better way to organize what I know about barrier-free technology. Plus, I needed a way to practice and play with new technology. End result? This site!</p>
  <p>First off, what is digital accessibility and why do librarians care about it?</p>
  <p>Digital accessibility means making sure that everybody can use a digital product with their own ways of access. By way of access I mean the range of ways we access the web: sight, sound, speech, cognition, touch.</p>
  <p>A person might have broken their headphones. They might be hard of hearing. They might be learning a new language. For all these reasons or a combination, that person might prefer text to access content originally in audio format. One of the principles of digital accessibility is to transcribe audio material. Doing so, we guarantee their access to information.</p>
  <p>Librarians should be leaders in digital accessibility for a very core and simple reason. Our job is to make sure that everyone has access to all information. Well, accessibility means removing barriers to information.</p>
  <p>All views my own. </p>
