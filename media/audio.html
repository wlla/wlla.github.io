    <h2>Players</h2>
    <p>Be sure to share audio through an accessible interface. <a href="https://wlla.github.io/media/media-players.html">Read more on the Media Players page</a>.</p>
    <h2>Audio Content</h2>
    <p>Audio must have a transcript. The benefits of providing transcripts are numerous. They are essential for someone who is Deaf or Deaf-Blind. They can be used by someone just learning the language of the content. They allow all users to be multi-modal in their consumption of the content. They allow for text search of the content. They improve access to scholars. They improve SEO. I'll stop there, but transcripts are great.</p>
    <h2>Prerecorded Audio</h2>
    <p>Prerecorded audio are required to have transcripts. A transcript identifies speakers and contains text of all the speech and meaningful sound. Meaningful sounds include sound effects, clapping, laughter, etc.</p>
    <p>You can present a transcript as plain text in webpage or in a document. Time-stamped transcripts can be presented in a variety of formats including WebVTT.</p>
    <h2>Transcription Tools</h2>
    <p>Technology for computer generated transcription is improving every day. It's starting to be incorporated into more products, Google Chat for example.</p>
    <h3>CADET - Caption And Description Editing Tool</h3>
    <p>Free tool for creating writing captions and video description tracks. Tool will let you know estimated speech time for text so you can write scripts to fit into a tracks quite periods. Once you write video description, you will want to narrate it or turn it into computer synthesized speech tracks outside of the tool.</p>

    <h2>Audio Controls</h2>
    <p>Avoid having media that automatically plays. If you do have audio that automatically plays, you'll need to follow level AA success criteria: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=142#audio-control">WCAG 2.1 1.4.2 Audio Control</a>.</p>
    <p>This success criteria requires that if you have audio that plays more than 3 seconds, a user must be able to pause or stop the audio, or they must be able to control the audio volume indepentently of their device's overall volume.</p>
    <h2>Low or No Background Audio</h2>
    <p>WCAG 2.1 1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio is a level AAA success criteria applying to certain audio-only content. This content must be:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Audio-only</li>
      <li>Primarily speech</li>
      <li>Not an audio CAPTCHA or logo</li>
      <li>Not musical in nature</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For this type of audio content, the success criteria says that either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no background noise.</li>
      <li>You can turn off the background noise.</li>
      <li>The background noise is 20 decibels lower, or about 4x quieter, than the foreground speech.</li>
    </ul>
