    <h2>Captions</h2>
    <p>Captions should be time-stamped, identify speakers, and capture speech and meaningful sounds.</p>
    <h3>Closed versus Open Captions</h3>
    <p>Open captions are burned into the video itself, they are part of the visual content of the video. They cannot be turned off. They are most common in an exhibition type situation. Once they become part of the video, their styling doesn't change.</p>
    <p>Closed captions means a user can turn them on or off in the interface. These are the most common type of captions. Captioning includes styling information set by the admin and media player. Some media players also let the user control those display settings, which is nice.</p>

    <h2>Video Description or Audio Description</h2>
    <p>Video and audio description are related terms. Audio description is an audio track describing the action happening in a video. Video description is a more generic term than audio description since it might take the form of text.</p>
    <p>There are two types of audio description, standard and extended. With standard audio description, the description fits into lulls in the sound of the video. A standard audio described video will be the same length as the non-described version.</p>
    <p>With extended audio description, a video will actually be paused to allow for a description. Extended audio description is important when a video doesn't naturally accomodate the level of description needed. A big use case would be an educational video covering a complex topic that requires more room than the lulls. A video with extended audio is going to have a longer run-time than the non-described version.</p>
