    <h1>Regions</h1>
    <p>Consider this webpage. Think about when you first visited. You probably scaned it and got a sense of the different high level sections of the page: the header, navigation sections, and the main section. Depending on where you came from you then focused on one of those areas to complete your task be it read about regions or navigate to another section.</p>
    <p>In HTML, these high level chunks of the page are landmark regions. You scan them with a screenreader or visually. To make sure that they are available to assistive technologies, you need to make sure that you are semantically marking up your landmark regions.</p>
    <p>Landmark regions may also be referred to as navigational landmark regions or navigational landmarks.</p>
    <h2>Landmark Regions</h2>
    <p>You can create semantic landmark regions with HTML5 elements and ARIA landmark roles. You should only use the ARIA roles if there is no equivalent landmark region in HTML5.</p>
    <p>Using certain HTML5 sectioning elements, like <code>header</code> or <code>main</code>, will automatically create a landmark region. With ARIA you add landmark role attributes to an element to create a landmark region. Add the <code>role</code> attribute and define it with one of the eight ARIA roles: banner, navigation, main, complimentary, contentinfo, search, form, application. Application role is tricky and changes keyboard behavior.</p>
    <h3>Landmark Region Checklist</h3>
    <p>The rest of this page has more details on regions and how to create the, but for a quick checklist review the following.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure all the content of a webpage is within a region.</li>
      <li>Some types of landmark regions, you should only use once at the top level, some can be used multiple times. These are noted in the table below.</li>
      <li>Similar to headings, think about what is a manageable and useful number of landmark regions. A simple page probably won't have 20 regions.</li>
      <li>Every webpage should have a <code>`main`</code> and one <code>`main`</code> only.</li>
      <li>The main region is often the target of a skip link.</li>
      <li>You can add names to regions using <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
      <li>When you have multiple regions of the same type, they must have unique and descriptive names.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Naming Landmark Regions</h3>
    <p>When you have multiple regions of the same type or when you are using a generic region type like <code>section</code> create an accessible name. Add a unique and descriptive label with an <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute.</p>
    <p>For example, this page has a navigation region with links to all the pages in the Structure section of the site. I've added an <code>aria-label="Secondary"</code>. to make it more descriptive. A screenreader announces the name and the type of region so it is identified as "Secondary navigation region".</p>

    <h2>Screenreaders & Regions</h2>
    <p>With screenreaders, you can skim through all the regions in a page in order to navigate to important sections and get a sense of the page content (the way some users might visually scan for that info.) When navigation through the content of a page, a screenreader will also announce when you enter or leave a region.</p>
    <p>A screenreader will announce the region type and, if there is one, region label.</p>
    <p>There are keyboard shortcuts for skimming through all the regions in a page or through all the regions of a certain type in a page.</p>
    <p>When you first navigate to a page with a screenreader, it may announce the total number of regions on a page. </p>
    <!-- <p>Here is what NVDA might sound like when it visits this webpage for the first time.</p> -->
    <h2>Assistive Technologies & Regions</h2>
    <p>Assistive technologies can also mask certain landmark regions. Reader views might show a view of just the <code>main</code> element of the page. Reader views are often built into browsers on mobile, but a user could have similar settings for any device. These viewing options can improve legibility and remove distractions.</p>
    <h2>Checking for Regions</h2>
    <p>On webpages, you can check for headings with the WAVE tool or the aXe tools. You can also check with the visual bookmarklet. You can also check with a screenreader by skimming through regions</p>
