    <h2>Elements and Regions</h2>
    <p>On the web, the HTML element `nav` should be used for navigation. Using this element will create a navigation region. If you have multiple navigation regions on a page, give each one a unique name with the `aria-label` attribute. Remember that the type of region will be announced by the screenreader so there's no need to include the words "navigation" or "region" in the label. The <a href="region.html">Region page</a> has more details on all these points.</p>
    <h2>Sitemap</h2>
    <p>People should be able to orient themselves to your materials. On the web, it's good to provide an overall map of your site. A sitemap supports success criteria 2.4.5 Multiple Ways and 2.4.8 Location, both part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#navigable">2.4 Guideline: Navigable</a>.</p>
    <h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
    <p>Breadcrumbs are a list of links, usually towards the beginning of a page before the main content. The communicate where you are in the structure of the site.</p>
    <p>Let's break this down. A decent pattern for breacrumbs would be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Breadcrumbs are in a `nav` element.</li>
      <li>The nav element has a unique name `aria-label="Breadcrumbs"`. When a screenreader hits this section of the page, it will announce something like "Breadcrumbs navigation region".</li>
      <li>Links are organized in a list.</li>
      <li>There should be some visual formatting between links to help reinforce the hierarchy. Often this will be a forward slash or >. This information is communicated in list form: each link is its own list item and the organization of the list from first to last communicate the hierarchy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pagination</h2>
    <p>With pagination, you want to communicate the range, give people agency to skip to any pages, and communicate to everyone which page is selected.</p>
    <p>Pagination should be in a <code>nav</code> element with a unique and descriptive name like <code>aria-label=pagination</code>.</p>
    <p>If you're dealing with a set of page numbers, organize them in a list. Indicate which page is selected in a programmatic way, like with visibly hidden text or ARIA attributes. Let people jump to desired pages. Depending on how many pages you're dealing with, include a dropdown or input to let people skip.</p>
    <p>If your new page content is created with JS, as with a single page application, build it so everyone is notified when the new content loads; make that information available to screenreaders.</p>
    <p>My personal preference is also to always have your URL constructed in a way so that people can update the URL to navigate to a desired page.</p>
    <p>Getting rid of pagination is a bad idea. This happens with the infinite scroll pattern or adding a "see more" button to dynamically load in more content. Using these patterns can cause navigation issues.</p>
