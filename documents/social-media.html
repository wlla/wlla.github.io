    <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
    <p>There are some guidelines for all social media</p>
    <p>Social media is about sharing. Make sure what you are sharing is accessible. The <a href="media.html">Media section</a> covers details on requirements for images, audio, and video; to recap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Images: include alt text and, if needed, long description</li>
        <li>Audio: include transcript</li>
        <li>Videos: include captions and description</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On social media, if you are sharing images with text, make sure the text has good contrast and is repeated in the text of the post.</p>
      <p>If you retweet or link to other people's materials make sure the authors paid attention to accessibility.</p>
    <p>Avoid using fancy fonts. It can be a trend to update handles and posts to have special fonts, but these nearly all have poor or incomplete legibility.</p>
    <p>Use camel case with hashtags. You can't have a space between words in a hashtag. To help people break apart different words, use a capital letter at the start of each word. Capitalizing concatenated words (words with no spaces between them) is called camel case because the bumps of the capital letters are like a camel's humps. The hashtag #RomanceReaders is more legible than #romancereaders.</p>
    <h2>Twitter</h2>
    <p>To add alt text to images on Twitter, you must first update your profile settings to support alt text. This is a one-time step. (Why this step exists and isn't on by default is a good question for Twitter.) Once you've updated your settings, you can add alt text when you compose tweets. <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions">Twitter Help Center on adding alt text</a>.</p>
      <h3>Twitter Cards</h3>
      <p>Twitter cards are information that get automatically attached to your tweet when you share certain URLs. The site creator sets up what information they'd like pulled in through an API. (API stands for Application programming interface, it's a way for different digital websites, databases, and products to interact and communitcate with one another.)</p>
      <p>The Twitter card API supports pulling in alt text. Make sure you include this when setting up your Twitter cards otherwise, the image will be inaccessible when shared on Twitter.</p>
      <h2>Instagram</h2>
      <p>Add alt text to all your Instagram posts. Instagram adds automatic alt text, but we want alt text as good as our angles. <a href="https://help.instagram.com/503708446705527">Instagram help center on how to add and edit alt text</a>.</p>
      <h2>Facebook</h2>
      <p>Facebook also adds automatic alt text to images as a base we need to edit and revise. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/www/214124458607871">Facebook Help Center article on editing alt text.</a> Note: as of mid-July 2019, you could only edit alt text a computer or iOS device. You can update alt text of an already posted photo.</p>
      <p>Add captions to videos you post. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/www/261764017354370?helpref=related">Facebook Help Center Article on adding or removing captions</a>.</p>
      <p>Add captions to your FacebookLive videos. How to add captions depends on how you are livestreaming.</p>
