    <h2 id="staples">The staples</h2>
    <p>Follow some of the basics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't use images of text.</li>
      <li>Don't rely soley on color.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="docs2">.docs to PDFs</h2>
    <p>A common way to create a PDF is to save a document as a PDF from an author tool like Microsoft Word, Open Office, or Google Docs. (Or from a slide-show tool.) When you do this, first be sure that your document is accessible in the authoring software; follow the guidelines and best practices for Word, Google Docs, etc.</p>
    <h2 id="basic">Basic Adobe Acrobat Techniques</h2>
    <p>Adobe Acrobat has three editing panels that affect accessibility. Reading panel, Content panel, and Tags panel. That tags panel ultimitely controls the reading order and semantics of a pdf that matter for accessible technologies. What's confusing is that sometimes this is parallel to the information in the Order panel and sometimes they get out of sync with each other. Ultimitely, remember to check the tags panel of your PDF.</p>
    <h3 id="semantics">Semantics</h3>

    <h2 id="qc">Quality Control</h2>
    <h3 id="checker">Accessibility Checker</h3>
    <p>Adobe has a built in accessibility checker that will catch things for you like missing alt text or skipped headings. Note: the tool cant check for all accesibility requirements; for example, it can't tell if the alt text is useful or not.</p>
    <p>Older versions of Word do not have an accessibility checker.</p>
    <h3 id="prep">Preparing for sharing</h3>
    <p>It's a good idea to check your document for details you do not want published. Word automatically adds information, like your account name to the author field of a documents metadata, which may or may not be appropriate for your document.</p>
    <h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
    <h2 id="forms">Forms</h2>
    <p>If you're creating a form in a PDF, consider if you can create that form in an accessible web page instead.</p>
    <h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
    <p>Like any digital form, make sure that labels are persistent and well formatted. Each input should have a form associated with it.</p>
