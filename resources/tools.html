    <h2>Accessibility Bookmarklets</h2>
    <a href="https://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/">Accessibility Bookmarklets</a>
    <p>These bookmarklets are handy for checking a published page's headings and region structure. I use these visually. You can read the same information with a screenreader through region and heading shortcuts.</p>
    <h2>WebAIM Screen Reader Articles</h2>
    <p>Introductions and common shortcuts for a set of screen readers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://webaim.org/articles/jaws/">Testing wtih JAWs</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://webaim.org/articles/nvda/">Testing wtih NVDA</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/">Testing wtih VoiceOver</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool</h2>
    <a href="https://trace.umd.edu/peat">trace.umd.edu/peat</a>
    <p>This is a free, open source tool and quick to install. You can us it review mp4s for dangerous flashing. It can also use it to make a screengrab, so you can check your animations.</p>
    <h2>aXe</h2>
    <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">Deque aXe Downloads</a>
    <p>I use the browser plug-ins of these, but there are also versions you can integrate into automated testing. As of June 2019, a mobile version was published for Anroid. I played around with the Android one, mostly for color contrast and target size. Similar to WAVE tool.</p>
    <h2>WebAIM Color Contrast Checker</h2>
    <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker</a>
    <p>There are tons of contrast checkers out there. I like this one because it gives you the contrast ratio and the breakdown pass/fail for small and large type, plus UI components! You can link to results too which is nice.</p>
    <h2>WAVE</h2>
    <p>Feed this tool a website url and it will flag issues like missing alt text and missing or incorrect struture. Can use on WAVE website or with plug-ins for free. There are some paid options for testing at bulk. Similar to axe tool.</p>
    <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/"></a>
    <h2>HTML Validator</h2>
    <p>Please follow HTML. The great thing about standards is that they save us work. Behaving in expected ways means assistive technologies can work with your work, plus it's got much better chances of existing in the future.</p>
    <p>There are tons of ways to check that your HTML is good (it is after all the bedrock of the web!) I use the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri">W3C Validator</a>.</p>
    <h2>Hemingway Editor</h2>
    <p>Online tool with feedback on text like Reading level, passive voice, and other facets of readibility.</p>
    <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Editor</a>
    <h2>Screenreaders</h2>
    <p>Screenreaders are powerful software and like all software, they can take practice to learn all the ins and outs. If you're not someone who uses a screenreaer all the time, be aware of what might be user error and start to learn the syntax of a screenreader.</p>
    <h2>CADET - Caption And Description Editing Tool</h2>
    <p>Free tool for creating writing captions and video description tracks. Tool will let you know estimated speech time for text so you can write scripts to fit into a tracks quite periods. Once you write video description, you will want to narrate it or turn it into computer synthesized speech tracks outside of the tool.</p>
