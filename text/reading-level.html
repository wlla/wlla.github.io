      <p>There is a misconception that reading level is about writing for a target age-demographic. This is not true. Reading level is not about the ideas communicated, but about the way it is being communicated. You could have a racy book or a complex legal document with written for older readers that is written in plain language at an XX reading level.</p>
      <blockquote><p lang="fr">Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.</p><p>I would have written less but I had not the time.</p><cite><p>Blaise Pascal</p></cite></blockquote>
      <p>WCAG 2.1 has a level AAA success criteria for writing to XX grade level.</p>
      <p>Reading levels are determined by set formulas with variables for things like average sentence length, number of words, and number of syllables.</p>
      <p>There are a couple different ways of determining reading level. Common are the Flesch Reading Ease test and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level test.</p>
    <h2>Reading Level Resources</h2>
    <h3>Hemingway Editor</h3>
    <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Editor</a>
    <p>The Hemingway Editor will give you a reading level and numbers like total words. It will also flag things like passive voice. The highlighting functionality is based on color so may not work for all. The tool seems to just support English language grading.</p>
    <h3>MS Word</h3>
    <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-your-document-s-readability-and-level-statistics-85b4969e-e80a-4777-8dd3-f7fc3c8b3fd2#ID0EABBAAA=Windows">Microsoft article on checking reading level</a>
    <p>Microsoft Word's "Readability statistics" give you a documents reading level. It's a little roundabout to get to since you need to first run the spelling and grammar checker, but it does give you info on two different reading level scores. It is also able to give the reading level more languages than English.</p>
