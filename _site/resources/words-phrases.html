    <h1>Words and Phrases - DRAFT</h1>
        <p>In the list below, entries commonly used with acronyms and abbreviations start with those. Instead of being tagged with an `abbr` I have added an aria-label to make sure they are read out as individual letters.</p>
    <h2>Vocabulary List</h2>
    <dl class="definitions">
      <dt>Accessible</dt>
      <dd>To me, accessible means able to be used, read, operated, interacted with by everyone. When spelled with a capital letter, Accessibility usually refers to </dd>
      <dt>Assistive Technology</dt>
      <dd>Tools to help complete a task. Assistive technology include things like canes and glasses. In a digital context, they include things like screen magnfiers, screenreaders, and voice recognition. Covered in more depth in the Assistive Technology page.</dd>
      <dt>ARIA - Accessible Rich Internet Applications</dt>
      <dd>ARIA is a technical specification that helps make sure that dynamic content is accessible to all. Dynamic content meaning things that change on the web. This is often handled by HTML, but some JavaScript applications don't get picked up by assistive technology. As HTML develops, it often makes ARIA obsolete. ARIA is implemented as HTML attributes.</dd>
      <dt>Barrier free / Accessibility barrier</dt>
      <dd>Barrier free is the term used in German that means Accessible. An accessi</dd>
      <dt>Braille / braille</dt>
      <dd>With a lowercase "b", braille is an 8 point tactile reading and writing developed by Louis Braille. When capitalized, Braille is a surname/lastname. Most famously of Louis Braille who as a teenager invented the braille reading and writing system. </dd>
      <dt>CAPTCHA - Completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart</dt>
      <dd>CAPTCHA manifest as little tasks to perform, like identifying features in images or sound, or clicking a checkbox. The idea behind it is to block malicious software like bots from spamming or otherwise being bad actors. The problem is that the CAPTCHA aren't so accessible in format and they will problematically lump good, assistive technology like screenreaders into the "bad software" bucket.</dd>
      <dt>Component</dt>
      <dt>DOM, Page DOM</dt>
      <dd>DOM stands for Document Object Model, its essentially a list of all the things on a web page. It is created by the HTML of the page. It is the basis for the Accessibility Tree.</dd>
      <dt>Dragon Naturally Speaking</dt>
      <dd>A speech recognition tool; This assistive technology is used to navigate and create digital materials using voice commands.</dd>
      <dt>EPUB - Electronic Publication</dt>
      <dd>EPUB is the most common format for an electronic book. It's essentially a wrapper of HTML. Covered in more depth in the Documents section.</dd>
      <dt>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</dt>
      <dd>A standard for creating web pages. This is what most web pages are built with. Understanding HTML is a cornerstone to accessbility.</dd>
      <dt>JS - Javascript</dt>
      <dd>A coding language that is often used in web technologies to make actions happen. Sometimes "Vanilla Javascript" is used to describe JavaScript that is just written straight-up without any frameworks like React or Angular.</dd>
      <dt>JAWs, Job Access With Speech</dt>
      <dd>JAWs is a widely used screenreader. It works with PC computers. It is paid. More details in the Assistive Technology page.</dd>
      <dt>MAGic</dt>
      <dd>MAGic is a screen magnifying tool.</dd>
      <dt>Modal</dt>
      <dd>A modal is also called a pop-up. It takes the form of a small window that visually appears over a webpage and covers it partially. Sometimes, the page beneath will be faded or otherwise made to look inactive. It should become the focus for assistive technologies. Modals are everywhere, but are not good for cognitive accessibility and usually have tons of additional issues including keyboard navigation. More details in the UI Components page.</dd>
      <dt>PDF - Portable Document Format</dt>
      <dd>A common format for sharing documents. It was developed by Adobe. PDFs include many features similar to HTML, including a tree determining reading order and content types like lists and headings. Many people like them because they are not editable; or rather, they are more difficult to edit. PDFs can be quite complex to remediate. It is always good to do as much work as possible in an authoring tool. PDFs are covered in the Documents section.</dd>
      <dt>Programmatically, Programmatically Available</dt>
        <dd>Available to other technologies. If a button label is programmatically available, that means that the label isn't just visually on the button, but is tied to the button in code in predicatable ways. When a button name is programmatically available, a screen reader can read it. When something can be programmatically set, that means it can be operated with other technologies, like a keyboard input or a voice command. The Structure and UI Components section cover requirements for programmatically available info.</dd>
      <dt>Screenreader</dt>
      <dd>A Screenreader is a software that reads out the content and structure of digital material. More details in the Assistive Technology page.</dd>
      <dt>Semantic, Semantic web</dt>
      <dd>In a digital context, semantics means shared standards and definitions which make information available to computers. In other words, using web semantics make something programmatically available. It is frequently used when describing a page structure or mark-up, espcially headings. In HTML, a semantic heading is a heading marked-up using the <code>h1</code> - <code>h6</code> elements.</dd>
      <dt>SEO - Search Engine Optimization</dt>
      <dd>For search engines to work, they first scan all webpages and collect information on them. This includes gathering up specific metadata fields and reviewing the text on the page. Alt text converts the information in an image into text. As a side benefit of accessibility, alt text makes it easier for a search engine to parse what is on the page and include it in relevant searches.</dd>
      <dt>Single Page Application (SPA)</dt>
      <dt>Synthesized Speech</dt>
      <dt>TalkBack</dt>
      <dt>Visible Focus</dt>
      <dt>VoiceOver</dt>
      <dt>WAI - Web Accessibility Initiative</dt>
      <dt>WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</dt>
        <dd>The international standard for digital accessibility. I prefer to use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref">WCAG (Quick Reference)</a></dd>
      <dt>WebVTT</dt>
        <dd>A time-stamped format for transcripts and captions. A webVTT file is just an text file with specific formatting conventions. WebVTT format is good for text alternatives because people can manipulate how they display with things like size, placement, and font and background color.</dd>
      <dt>W3C - World Wide Web Consortium</dt>
