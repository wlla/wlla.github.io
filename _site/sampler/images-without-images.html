  <h1>Sampler Images without images</h1>
  <p>There is a version of this page with all the same samples, but with photos intentionally broken so they do not appear. This is to see how these combos would appear to someone with a not-so-powerful internet connection or who doesn't load images.</p>

  <h4 id="image-description">Image Description</h4>
  <p>Photograph of a small building sitting in and empty lot. Grass is growing through cracks in the cement. Behind the building, the lot ends in a clear line with a chain link fence. To the viewers left is a low building, painted a deep and bright yellow, with a tin roof starting to rust. Directly behind the building and to the viewers right, are green trees and plants, some growing around and in front of the fence. Another low building sits in behind the foliage.</p>
  <p>The building itself is in the center of photo, sitting at an angle so the viewer can see the front of the building towards the left and the side of the building towards the right. It is small, painted white, and was once used as a gas station. The building is one story in the adobe style, a facade adds decorative moldings on the top of the building and the tops of the front door, side door, and three windows. The font door and windows are covered with black grills that have decorative curlicues and trim. In the front of the building, individual signs of red letters spell out "TACO LOCO". On the side of the building red spray paint spells out "Coming Soon." On the concrete in front of the buidling sits a messy pile of eight tires. The focus of the photo is sharp and the colors saturated.</p>
